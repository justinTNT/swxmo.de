SWXMOde: Sammy | (something-like)Weld | eXpress | MOngoose | noDE

This is just how I do it :
if you have the same design criteria and infrastructure,
you might like to do it this way to.

so I offer here the few threads it takes to stich these components together,
along with a bare-bones example app (to come)
and an empty template for the browser script (to come)

more documentation upon request...
