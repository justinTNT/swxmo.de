SWXMOde: Sammy | (something-like)Weld <=> eXpress | MOngoose | noDE

This is just how I do it :
if you have the same design criteria and infrastructure,
you might like to do it this way too.

Most probably, you'll just want to take a look and do something slightly different.
(eg. use view modules in sammy and express, which I have forsaken)

so here's the few threads it takes to stich these components together,
along with a bare-bones example app (one day we'll EYODF)
and an empty template for the browser script (to come)

browserscripts, including jquery, are just touched:
you can find the latest versions for yself.

new:
barebones of admin is in place : a lot more work to go before we can EYODF
browserbootstrap for sammy
ugly but workable build script
