SWXMOde: Something-like Weld (anti-templating) | eXpress | MOngoose | noDE

This is just how I do it :
if you have the same design criteria and infrastructure,
you might like to do it this way too.

Most probably, you'll just want to take a look and do something slightly different.
(eg. use sammy in the browser, or view modules in express)

so here's the few threads it takes to stich these components together,
along with a bare-bones example app (one day we'll EOODF)
and an empty template for the browser script (to come)

browserscript dependencies like jquery are just touched: find the latest versions for yself.
